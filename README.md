# Interesting-Sites - catalog of various sites
<p>The Internet is full of sites that are worth seeing. </p>
<p>This list includes some of them. </p>
<p>Some you'd probably rather never see. </p>

### Available here: https://lilixil.github.io/Interesting-Sites/


Some pages may no longer be available. If this would happen feel free to report it <a href="https://github.com/lilixil/Interesting-Sites/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">here</a>, I will then replace the link with a link to the web archive.

Most of the links came from the no longer available goodsites.tech site, and creating Interesting-Sites to not lose them proved to be a good idea.
