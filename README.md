# Interesting-Sites

The Internet is full of sites that are worth seeing. This list includes some of them. Some you'd probably rather never see.

You can browse them here: https://lilixil.github.io/Interesting-Sites/

Some pages may no longer be available. If this would happen feel free to report it <a href="https://github.com/lilixil/Interesting-Sites/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">here</a>, I will then replace the link with a link to the web archive.

Most of the links came from the no longer available goodsites.tech site, and creating Interesting-Sites to not lose them proved to be a good idea.
